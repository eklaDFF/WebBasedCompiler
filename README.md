This Project is based on SpringBoot. Idea of this project is to enable Online Editing of Codes written in different Programming Languages although there is enough projects like this but they are require premium membership or lacks some functions.
We are using Manaco library to reach IDE level code editing and Xtern to reach real command like interface for I/O.
